## Lab Overview

This lab provides a comprehensive introduction to text classification using machine learning techniques. Students will learn how to preprocess text data, extract features, train multiple classification models, and evaluate their performance using various metrics and visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

1. **Load and explore text datasets** using scikit-learn's built-in datasets
2. **Preprocess text data** using TF-IDF vectorization with advanced parameters
3. **Split data properly** using train-validation-test methodology
4. **Implement multiple classification algorithms** (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
5. **Evaluate model performance** using comprehensive metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
6. **Visualize results** through confusion matrices, performance comparisons, and feature importance plots
7. **Analyze model interpretability** and make predictions on new text samples
8. **Perform cross-validation** for robust model evaluation

## Dataset: 20 Newsgroups

The lab uses the famous **20 Newsgroups dataset**, which contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different categories including:
- Computer technology (comp.graphics, comp.os.ms-windows.misc, etc.)
- Recreation (rec.sport.baseball, rec.autos, etc.)
- Science (sci.med, sci.electronics, etc.)
- Politics and religion (talk.politics.misc, talk.religion.misc, etc.)
